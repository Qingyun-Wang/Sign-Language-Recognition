Sign Language Recognition 

• Enhanced Sign Language recognition by engineering a CNN with TensorFlow,achieving an exceptional accuracy of over 95% in recognizing English alphabets from images.

• Designed the CNN framework with multiple 2D convolution layers, Max Pooling 2D, and densely connected layers, opti- mizing feature extraction and enhancing learning effectiveness, based on a dataset comprising more than 30,000 images.

• Boosted the model’s reliability and robustness by implementing advanced techniques such as data augmentation, dropout, batch normalization, and regularization, effectively mitigating overfitting.
