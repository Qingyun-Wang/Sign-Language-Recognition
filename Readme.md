Sign Language Recognition 

• EnhancedSignLanguagerecognitionbyengineeringaCNNwithTensorFlow,achievinganexceptionalaccuracyofover 95% in recognizing English alphabets from images.
• Designed the CNN framework with multiple 2D convolution layers, Max Pooling 2D, and densely connected layers, opti- mizing feature extraction and enhancing learning effectiveness, based on a dataset comprising more than 30,000 images.
• Boosted the model’s reliability and robustness by implementing advanced techniques such as data augmentation,
dropout, batch normalization, and regularization, effectively mitigating overfitting.
